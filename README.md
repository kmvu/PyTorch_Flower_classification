# PyTorch_Flower_classification
A challenge to classify 102 types of flowers using Deep Learning

Overview We have created a 102 category dataset, consisting of 102 flower categories. The flowers chosen to be flower commonly occuring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images. The details of the categories and the number of images for each class can be found on this category statistics page.

The images have large scale, pose and light variations. In addition, there are categories that have large variations within the category and several very similar categories. The dataset is visualized using isomap with shape and colour features.

This Competition is made by enthusiasts to create an Un-Official LeaderBoard for Udacity's PyTorch FB Challenge..
